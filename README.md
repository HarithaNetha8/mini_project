📌 Abstract
--
Phishing websites imitate legitimate platforms to steal sensitive user information such as login credentials and financial data. Traditional phishing detection techniques—such as blacklist checking and basic URL analysis—often fail against newly created or visually deceptive phishing websites.

PhishGuard enhances real-time phishing detection by integrating Machine Learning (ML) for URL-based analysis, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for screenshot-based visual detection, and a user feedback mechanism for continuous improvement. By combining URL analysis, image processing, and adaptive learning, PhishGuard delivers a robust and intelligent phishing detection system capable of addressing evolving cyber threats.

🧠 Introduction
--
What is Phishing?
Phishing is a cyberattack in which attackers impersonate trusted organizations to deceive users into revealing sensitive information via fake emails, websites, or messages. These attacks can lead to identity theft, financial losses, and major data breaches.

Why is Phishing Detection Important?
--
Traditional methods fail against visually deceptive phishing websites
Helps prevent identity theft
Reduces financial fraud
Protects sensitive personal and organizational data

📚 Literature Survey (Summary)
--
Paper	Key Observation	Limitation
ML-Based Phishing Detection (2022)	Uses URL and blacklist analysis	No visual detection
CNN & Bi-LSTM Detection	Uses deep learning	No real-time feedback
Advanced ML & DL Models (2024)	High accuracy reported	Real-world false positives not addressed

🚀 Proposed System
--
The proposed system improves phishing detection accuracy and adaptability by combining multiple detection techniques.

🔑 Core Features
--
ML-based URL Detection
CNN-based Screenshot Analysis
User Feedback Mechanism
Real-Time Alerts

✅ Advantages of Proposed System
--

Real-time phishing alerts
Hybrid detection (URL + visual analysis)
User-friendly interface
Continuous improvement using user feedback
Better resistance to zero-day phishing attacks

🏗️ System Architecture (Overview)
--

User submits a URL

▶️ How to Run the Project
--
📌 Prerequisites

Node.js (v18+)
npm
VS Code

🟢 Run Backend (Server)

cd server
npm install
npm install --save-dev cross-env
npm run dev
cross-env is used to avoid NODE_ENV issues on Windows.

🔵 Run Frontend (Client)
cd client
npm install
npm run dev

🌐 Application URLs

Frontend: http://localhost:5173
Backend: http://localhost:5000
❗ Common Issue & Fix (Windows)
Error
'NODE_ENV' is not recognized as an internal or external command

Solution
Use cross-env to define environment variables:
npm install --save-dev cross-env
